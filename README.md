  <h1>I am mentioning all the steps which i have done here</h1>
    
   <p>1.) First i have created a git assignment directory and after this i have change my current directory to git assignment directory
       2.) Then i have created a index.html file for checking password lessauthentication
       3.) Then i have generate a key through ssh-keygen and paste in Github
       4.) After this i have created a Git assignment branch
       5.) After this have created a secrets.txt file and abc.txt file and i have add abc.txt in stagging area and when i check status it is showing me secrets.txt is not added    because in secrets.txt i have added my github credentials so i don't want to push so for that i have created .gitignore and insideit i have added secrets.txt and again check status so it is showing me .gitignore rather then secrets.txt because my secrets.txt i have added in this hidden directory so when i push it will not showing me secrets.txt and when i push it will be push and when i open my .gitignore it will open but not showing secrets.txt content
    </p>
